Datasets for IDMC #IDETECT challenge on Unite Ideas

Datasets

1. Input dataset ( ~ 79 MB)

The input dataset contains a list of URLs (~ 600 thousand articles) in English extracted from the GDELT GKG database. The input dataset should be used as input for the analysis. It consists of a .csv file with three fields:

‣ “GKGRECORDID”, a unique identifier of the document, 

‣ “DATE”, the publication date-time of the document, 

‣ “DocumentIdentifier”, a fully-qualified URL that can be used to access the document on the web.

2. Training dataset 

The training dataset consists of a list of URLs tagged by our monitoring experts. We ask teams to mainly focus on “Conflict and violence” and “Disasters” and tag all the remaining documents as “Other”. The training dataset may contain documents not in English or URLs to videos which should be identified and not used for the training. 

3. Test dataset  (will be uploaded one week before the submission deadline.)
